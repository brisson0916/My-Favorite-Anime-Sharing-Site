# MY FAVORITE ANIME SHARING SITE

## Description
My first project of my professional portfolio. 
It is a web app in which users could log in, then create and edit their own list of favorite anime, and share it with others viewing the site.

It uses Bootstrap as frontend framework, Flask as backend framework, and PostgreSQL for database.

## Instructions
- Create an account first by providing a username, email, and password.

- After logging in, you can start to create your own Anime List.

- Then you could add anime to your list (search by title) or edit your list.

- Share your list with others!
